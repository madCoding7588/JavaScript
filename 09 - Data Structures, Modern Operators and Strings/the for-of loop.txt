the for-of loop

Q. let's say we want to move over our entire array?

const menu = [...restaurant.starterMenu, ...restaurant.mainMenu];
//we know how to use a regular for loop where we have to set a counter , a condition , then increment counter

// that's why we got for-of loop which dont need all of this

for(const variable of array)
for(const item of menu) console.log(item);
// here item variable points to each element in each iteration

output: 
Focaccia
Bruschetta
Garlic Bread
Caprese Saad
Pizza
Pasta
Risotto

// we need not to do much work as in for loop and also we can use keywords like continue and break keywords.

Q. what if we also wanted the current index and not just the current element?
// in for-of loop it's bit pain when we need that index , becz for of loop was originally just ment to give the current element.
// However you can get both, you will have to do this:

// we call entries method on the menu array.
for(const item of menu.entries()){
console.log(item);
}

output:
[0,"Focaccia"]
[1,"Bruschetta"]
[2,"Garlic Bread"]
[3,"Caprese Saad"]
[4,"Pizza"]
[5,"Pasta"]
[6,"Risotto"]

console.log(menu.entries());
output:
Array Iterator{}

console.log([...menu.entries()]);
output:
[Array(2), Array(2),Array(2), Array(2), Array(2), Array(2), Array(2)]

// it is basically an array which in each position contains a new array, which contains element , element entity index number of that element in the original array


we can log something nice 

for(const item of menu.entries()){
console.log(`${item[0] + 1}: ${item[1]}`);
}

// now we are smart enough we don't need to manually take item[0] and item[1] , we can destructur it.

i -> index and el-> element.
for(const [i,el] of menu.entries()){
console.log(`${i+1}: ${el}`);

}

// so we could undersatad how destrucuring is usefull and same is applied for , for-of loop .


completed.
